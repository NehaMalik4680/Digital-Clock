A digital clock web application that displays the current time and date. It features a clean design with a dark background, using HTML and CSS for layout and styling. The clock updates every second, showing hours, minutes, and seconds in a large font. The date is displayed above the clock in a smaller font, formatted to include the day of the week and the full date. The JavaScript function handles the time retrieval and updates the displayed values dynamically.
